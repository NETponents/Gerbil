{"name":"Gerbil","tagline":"Automated hacking tool powered by a trainable AI engine.","body":"# Gerbil\r\n## What is it?\r\nGerbil is an automated hacking tool powered by a trainable AI engine. It was originally designed to be an automated network penetration tester by scanning your network for weak points. When it does find a weak point, it will use previous experience to decide how to attack the server.\r\n\r\n## Project State\r\nGerbil is still in it's early stages. Right now it's just a fancy network scanner. If you have experience in C#, feel free to contribute to help speed up development!\r\n\r\n## System requirements\r\nDoesn't matter if you have a Cray supercomputer or a potato. If it can run .NET 4.5, you are good to go.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\nTo get Gerbil, `git clone` this repository to your hard drive. From there, open up *~/Gerbil/Gerbil.sln* Using Visual Studio 2012 or later. Compile the project using the **Release** build profile. After which, check the *~/Gerbil/bin/release* folder and run *gerbil.exe*.\r\n\r\nBinary releases will be availible once we release a stable package of Gerbil.\r\n\r\n## Use\r\nGerbil uses a custom CLI. See the project wiki on the right-hand side for CLI command usage.\r\n\r\n## Obvious Legal Disclaimer\r\nSince this is technically a \"hacking tool\", NETponents, @ARMmaster17, or any other contributers cannot be held liable for actions taken by this software on either your own or someone elses network. We reccommend testing Gerbil on a protected private lab network since Gerbil does posses tools to potentially wipe/modify network computer hard disks.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

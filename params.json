It was originally designed to be an automated network penetration tester by scanning your network for weak points. When it does find a weak point, it will use previous experience to decide how to attack the server.\r\n\r\n[Read more >](http://github.com/NETponents/Gerbil/wiki)\r\n\r\n## Project State\r\nGerbil is still in it's early stages.

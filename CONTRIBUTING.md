## Making changes
Please make desired changes on a fork on your own GitHub account. Please neatly document your code and commit messages. The cleaner it is, the quicker your PR will be accepted.

## Submitting PRs
When you submit a pull request, our automated continous integration system will test your code. Your code will not be approved until all tests pass. Please make sure that you submit a PR to merge with the ***dev*** branch.

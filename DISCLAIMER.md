# Legal Disclaimer
This program is intended to be a fully featured automated hacker. As such, it has the ability to DDoS your network, remote control network workstations/computers, knock down firewalls and other blockades, and destroy the boot code on your hard drive. Because Gerbil contains this functionality, it is imperative that you understand that ***NO AUTHORS ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES***.

This program does contain an untrained AI engine. As such its actions are unpredictable because they depend on the quality of the training data. Because this creates an unaccountable "black box", no authors assume any responsibility for the decisions made by the AI engine.

It is 100% your responsibility to make sure that you only run Gerbil on a protected lab subnet that is protected from the rest of your network. One suggestion we offer is a simple VM network. As long as you input your parameters correctly, Gerbil will only attack the virtual machines, of which can be disposed of/reset when you are done.

By downloading/compiling and using Gerbil, you are agreeing to these terms. This document must be made available with any vanilla or modified distribution of Gerbil.
